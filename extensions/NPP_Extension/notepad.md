## Required Software

*Notepad++ is a Windows app. Installation of Notepad++ is fairly simple on Linux, but development (and installation) of plugins is problematic.* 

You will need the following on your Windows system for npp/codechat extension development:

## Installing Codechat
sourc
1. **Install Python** (Note: These directions apply to the Windows Store install of Python. If you install from the web, you need to replace "python" in the following commands with "py" and [make sure Python is in the PATH](https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/), possibly by simply checking the “Add Python 3.x to PATH” box, during installation.

2. **Open Windows terminal.** *Be sure to perform the following in Command Prompt, not Powershell*

3. **Update pip**

python -m pip install --upgrade pip

4. **Create a virtual environment named codechat** 

python -m venv codechat

5. **Activate this virtual environment**

 Windows 
.\codechat\Scripts\activate
 Ubuntu 
 source codechat/bin/activate

6. **Install the CodeChat Server**

python -m pip install --upgrade CodeChat_Server

7. **Determine the location of the installed CodeChat Server.** Remember this location - you'll need it when installing the CodeChat extension for VSC.

where CodeChat_Server

## Install the CodeChat extension/plugin for VSC

1. **Open Visual Studio Code**

2. **Ctrl-Shift-X to open the Extensions** 

3. **search for "codechat"**

4. **click Install**

5. **click the gear wheel to modify extension settings**

6. **Enter the location from "where CodeChat_Server" in "Code Chat.Code Chat Server: Command**". 

*Follow the directions and double up on backslashes*.

C:\Users\petel\codechat\Scripts\CodeChat_Server.exe =>
C:\\\Users\\\petel\\\codechat\\\Scripts\\\CodeChat_Server.exe

(used 3 backslashes for the markdown render)


## Notepad++ Links

**Currently you need to install the 32-bit version of Notepad++ since the methods for creating plugins create 32-bit plugins**

## Install a Notepad++ plugin

There are two ways:

1. **Plugins -> Plugin Admin** (for plugins already in the official repository)

2. Manually

    a. get the dll file e.g. SamplePlugin.dll

    b. make a subfolder in Program Files\Notepad++\plugins with the exact name of the plugin (not including extension) e.g. SamplePlugin

### Install MarkdownViewer++ (optional)

This is a Notepad++ plugin with similar functionality as desired in the CodeChat extension (e.g. split screen, rendered HTML of the currently selected file/tab, synchronized scrolling). Use Plugin Admin to install.

*Refresh doesn't seem to be working automatically, after a save, or via the menu. To refresh, click on the MarkdownViewer window and press CTRL-R*
